[dune-gdt](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-ohlberger/dune-community/dune-gdt) is a software library for building applications using grid-based numerical methods.
It is a generic discretization toolbox and provides building blocks - like local operators, local evaluations, local assemblers - for discretization methods and suitable discrete function spaces.
It is realized as a [DUNE](http://www.dune-project.org/) module and leverages newer C++ language features and the [dune-xt](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-ohlberger/dune-community/dune-xt)ensions to provide an easy-to-use and mathematically sound API.
A subset of the API is exposed as Python-bindings using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11), and easily available as [wheels on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dune-gdt/).
