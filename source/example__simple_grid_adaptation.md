```python
# wurlitzer: display dune's output in the notebook
%load_ext wurlitzer
%matplotlib notebook

import numpy as np
np.warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') # silence numpys warnings
```

```python
from dune.xt.grid import Dim, Simplex, make_cube_grid, visualize_grid

grid = make_cube_grid(Dim(2), Simplex(), [-1, -1], [1, 1], [1, 1])
print('initial grid')
_ = visualize_grid(grid)
print(f'grid has {grid.size(0)} elements')

# we require one global refinement for simlexgrids to obtain a symmetric grid
grid.global_refine(1)

print('once refined to obtain a symmetric grid')
_ = visualize_grid(grid)

print(f'grid has {grid.size(0)} elements')
```

```python
from dune.gdt import ContinuousLagrangeSpace, DiscreteFunction, AdaptationHelper

V_h = ContinuousLagrangeSpace(grid, order=1)
u_h = DiscreteFunction(V_h, name='u_h')

print(f'space has {V_h.num_DoFs} DoFs')
```

```python
adaptation_helper = AdaptationHelper(grid)
adaptation_helper.append(V_h, u_h)
```

```python
markers = np.array(adaptation_helper.markers, copy=False) # direct access to dune vector without copy
centers = np.array(grid.centers(0), copy=False)

elements_in_the_left_half = np.where(centers[:, 0] < 0)[0]
markers[elements_in_the_left_half] = 1
adaptation_helper.mark()
```

Lets have a look at the markers:

```python
print(markers)
```

```python
adaptation_helper.pre_adapt()
adaptation_helper.adapt()
adaptation_helper.post_adapt()
```

```python
print(f'grid has {grid.size(0)} elements')

_ = visualize_grid(grid)

print(f'space has {V_h.num_DoFs} DoFs')
```

Let us now have another look at the markers:

```python
print(markers)
print(len(markers))
print(grid.size(0))
```

Since the vector of markers has been resized along with the grid, the wrapped numpy array now contains garbage and/or is of wrong size.

**So after each adapt, we need to wrap it anew!**

```python
markers = np.array(adaptation_helper.markers, copy=False)

print(markers)
```

# keeping track of refined elements

We can also tell the helper to keep track of those elements which have been refined. Therefore we mark the elements in the left half again. **Note that we also need to wrap the centers again!**

```python
centers = np.array(grid.centers(0), copy=False)

elements_in_the_left_half = np.where(centers[:, 0] > 0)[0]
markers[elements_in_the_left_half] = 1
print(markers)
adaptation_helper.mark()
```

After marking we adapt the grid as before, but use the optional `indicate_new_elements` parameter.

```python
adaptation_helper.pre_adapt()
adaptation_helper.adapt()
adaptation_helper.post_adapt(indicate_new_elements=True)
```

```python
_ = visualize_grid(grid)
```

The grid was adapted as expected, but in addition ...

```python
markers = np.array(adaptation_helper.markers, copy=False)

print(markers)
```

... `adaptation_helper.markers` has not been cleared after adaptation but rather indicates the indices of those elements that have been created newly during the last call to `adapt()`.
In particular, we can use this to refine the same elements again:

```python
adaptation_helper.mark()
adaptation_helper.pre_adapt()
adaptation_helper.adapt()
adaptation_helper.post_adapt(indicate_new_elements=True)
```

```python
_ = visualize_grid(grid)
```
