If you have a question, please check the following first:

1. Check if your question has already been answered in the [FAQ][] section.
2. Make sure you've read the [documentation][]. Your issue may be addressed there.
3. If those resources didn't help and you only have a short question (not a bug report), consider asking in the [Gitter chat room][]
4. Search the [issue tracker][], including the closed issues, to see if your question has already been asked/answered. +1 or comment if it has been asked but has no answer.
5. If you have a more complex question which is not answered in the previous items (or not suitable for chat), please fill in the details below.
6. Include a self-contained and minimal piece of code that illustrates your question. If that's not possible, try to make the description as clear as possible.
